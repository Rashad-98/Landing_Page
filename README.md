# Landing Page Project

## description

The project files initially contained an HTMLfile containing three sections, a CSS file containing styles applied to the HTML file and an empty JavaScript file.
A fourth section was added to the HTML file and a navigation bar icon with its stylesheet source from 'www.w3schools.com', then it was linked to the JavaScript file. The CSS file was updated by adding some classes and using media query.
The JavaScript code was added to the .js file to make the page interactive. Two functions and three for loops were used to dynamically build the navigation bar for the sections and to manipulate the CSS classes of elements within the DOM to introduce interactivity to the page.
Now, when the page is scrolled, the section in view is highlighted both inside the window and in the navigation bar. Also when a section is clicked in the navigation bar, the page scrolls down to it. Finally, if the screen is resized where its width has become smaller than 600 pixels, the navigation bar gets hidden whith the current section being the only one shown on it and an icon appears. If the icon is clicked the navigation bar is shown vertically.
